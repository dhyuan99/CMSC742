The goal of the project is to improve the robustness of deep Q-learning by adding a simple regularization term. The regularization term serves as a random smoother and has been proved effective in classification task. In this project, we adapt the regularization term to reinforcement learning task and shows the effectiveness in the context of reinforcement learning. The detail of the algorithm can be viewed in our [final report](https://www.google.com).

We used CartPole as the environment setting and show the randomized smoothing
