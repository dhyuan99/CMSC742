The goal of the project is to improve the robustness of deep Q-learning by adding a simple regularization term. The regularization term serves as a random smoother and has been proved effective in classification tasks. In this project, we adapt the regularization term to reinforcement learning tasks and shows the effectiveness by experimenting in a simple environment setting. The detail of the algorithm can be viewed in our [final report](https://www.google.com).

We used CartPole as the environment setting and show the randomized smoothing
